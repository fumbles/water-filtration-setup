## SharkBite Connections
- I went with SharkBite connections since the cost wasn't much more(if you include the need for a crimp tool/crimp ring removal
  - It'd be nice to be able to repair leaks if one were to happen.  
- I have a new build house so I don't expect much more plumbing needs
- These were ridiculously easy to install and uninstall/redo.
